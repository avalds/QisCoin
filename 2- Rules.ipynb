    "1. Run the function using run button (or super + enter)\n",
    "2. Choose how many rounds you want to play 5, 10 or 20.\n",
    "3. Choose the AI: PPO2(p)(1), A2C(a)(2) or ACER(c)(3)\n",
    "4. You will be asked to confirm that you are ready. The timer will start when you press this button.\n",
    "5. You will be given a circuit which you are to guess/calculate whether it will be measured to be heads(1) or tails(0). (Your timer ends and the AI's timer starts as it gets to see the circuit.)\n",
    "6. The AI guesses/calculates what it thinks the measurement will give.\n",
    "7. The circuit is evaluated, and points distributed:\n",
    "  1. If you are correct you get 1 point else 0  \n",
    "  2. If the AI is correct it gets 1 point else 0  \n",
    "8. If you have not completed the number of rounds asked in 2. start from 4 again. else go to step  9.\n",
    "9. The game checks if you or the AI got a HIGHSCORE. If either of you get it it is added to the table.\n",
    "10. The previous highscores are shown and the game ends. To play again run the function again."
